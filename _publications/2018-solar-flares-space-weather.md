## Abstract

In this paper we present several methods to identify precursors that show great promise forearly predictions of solar flare events.
A data preprocessing pipeline is built to extract useful data from multiple sources, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites
and Solar Dynamics Observatory(SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), to prepare inputs for machine learning algorithms.
Two classification models are presented: classification of flares from quiet times for active regions and classification of strong versus weak flare events.
We adopt deep learning algorithms to capture both spatialand temporal information from HMI magnetogram data. Effective feature extraction
and feature selectio nwith raw magnetogram data using deep learning and statistical algorithms enable us to train classification models to
achieve almost as good performance as using active region parameters provided in HMI/Space-Weather HMI-Active Region Patch (SHARP) data files.
Case studies show a significant increase in the prediction score around 20 hr before strong solar flare events.
